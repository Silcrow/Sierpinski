# Sierpinski
> The first code I wrote by myself, without adult supervision, back in October 2017 â€” before diving into worklife.  

This project was my first self-initiated attempt to use Python creatively. The goal was to visualize the **Sierpinski Triangle** through random point generation and **OpenCV**. Itâ€™s a simple yet fun experiment where a point is drawn halfway between a random triangle corner and the current point in each iteration.

âœ… **Project Status**: Archived (Optional, based on your preference)  
ðŸ”¹ **Technologies Used**: OpenCV, Python  
ðŸ”¹ **Key Concepts**: Randomization, geometric patterns, basic image processing  

## Features:  
- Generates a visualization of the Sierpinski Triangle  
- Uses OpenCV for drawing and displaying the pattern  
- Experiment in randomness and geometric exploration  

### Known Issues:  
- The code may take time to generate the full pattern due to the number of iterations.
